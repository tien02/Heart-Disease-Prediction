# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Use Machine Learning building a model to predict a patient may whether get heart disease or not.

Dataset I clone from Kaggle, first I use Pandas library to read and cleaning data, then I try few models to see their score and choose a good ones. Next I use GridSearchCV to find the best parameter and finally I evaluate its using Confusion Matrix, F1 score to see how good a model is.
